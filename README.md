# ShrVN

![builds](https://github.com/ShrayzzDev/ShrVN/actions/workflows/builds.yml/badge.svg)\

A small Visual Novel type games engine. Not meant to be a serious nor commercial project. Not affiliated with any other engine. Name of the project may change in the future.

------------------------------------

## How to use it ?

For the moment, only command line is available to execute a project.
You have 2 options:
    - ShrVN -i/--interpret 'path_to_project'. Launch the interpretor of the engine.
    - ShrVN --init 'path' 'new_project_name'. Create an empty project at the given path.

------------------------------------

## What can it do ?

Nothing much for now, but documentation will be available at shrayzz.fr when I will setup the server.

------------------------------------
